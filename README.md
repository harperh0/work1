# About Work 1

## Overview

This project, part of the Digital Sandbox initiative, is a comprehensive endeavor involving data processing, web app development, and web page creation. The key components of this project include:

### Data Processing

Utilised the R programming language for meticulous data cleaning and collation. The emphasis was on ensuring data quality and preparing it for downstream analysis.

### Web App Buildup

Backend skills were employed, leveraging Node.js and API integration. This facilitated the establishment of connections, linking to MySQL for database management, and ensuring optimal functionality of the web application.

### Web Page Creation

The project features the creation of a dynamic web page incorporating interactive maps. HTML was the foundation, with coding efficiency optimised through the use of EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for templating.

## Technologies Used

- R
- Node.js
- API Integration
- MySQL
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- EJS

## Project Structure

The project is organised into distinct modules, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the overall objective. The clear segmentation allows for modularity and ease of maintenance.

### Data Processing Module

- Code files: `data.R`
- Data: `londonrentalstatisticsq22022.xls` and csv files in data folder

### Web App Module

- Code files: `config.js`, `index.js`, `select_from_db.js`
- Database: `hpai_work1.sql`

### Web Page Module

- HTML, EJS templates and CSS in shown HTML files

## Usage

### Data Processing

1. Go to the Data Processing module.
2. Follow the specified order to execute the R script for comprehensive data cleaning and collation.

### Web App Setup

1. Access the Web App module.
2. Start the web application by running Node.js files.
3. Ensure MySQL is running and correctly configured.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Data Handling:**
   - The original dataset `londonrentalstatisticsq22022.xls` underwent pre-processing in R and was segmented into multiple CSV files based on room types, all stored in the data folder.

2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Launch MAMP locally and access phpMyAdmin for Mac.
   - Create an SQL database and import datasets:
     - Borough: `Rents_borough.csv`
     - Ideas: `Bor_stu.csv` (with image inserts)
     - Postcodes: `Rents_postcode.csv`
   - To import the database, download `hpai_work1.sql`.

3. **App Configuration:**
   - Configure the app js files:
     - `index.js`: Sets up routes for APIs and lays out page indexing for display.
     - `config_local.js`: Specifies the connection with the SQL database.

4. **Styling with .ejs Files:**
   - HTML pages are styled using .ejs files.
   - The main page, `rental.html`, embeds 6 HTML pages, each displaying a room type with a geoJSON map.

### Viewing the App:

1. **Installation and Execution:**
   - Use the terminal make the downloaded code project folder ‘work1-main’ to your current working directory (use the cd command to navigate to it).
      - Run the following command.
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
       - Start the app server by typing the following command.
      ```bash
      node index.js
      ```

3. **Accessing the App:**
   Open a browser and go to http://localhost:5000.
